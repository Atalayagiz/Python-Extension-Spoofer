RLO (Right-to-Left Override) File Extension Changer
Welcome to the RLO File Extension Changer project! This tool allows you to cleverly change the appearance of file extensions using the Unicode RLO (Right-to-Left Override) character. With a few simple inputs, you can make a file appear as a different type, adding a layer of intrigue (or confusion!) to your file management.
